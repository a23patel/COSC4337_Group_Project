<h2> Description </h2>
 
 <p>Cancer detection in the early stages is a significantly useful tool for decreasing cancer mortality and improving outcomes for patients. This research focuses on comparing implementations of machine learning algorithms to classify different types of lung cancer. The models utilize pre-processed and regularized axial chest CT scans of patients with either one of three non-small-cell lung carcinomas, or no cancer. Traditional supervised learning models <b>Support Vector Classifiers (SVC)</b> and <b>Random Forest Classifiers (RFC)</b> are compared to deep learning models using <b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</b> by comparing their respective model accuracies and weighted F1 scores, with special care given to false positive and false negatives in cancer detection. The study uses techniques involving hyperparameter tuning, Dropouts, and regularization techniques to control overfitting in the CNN model and get an efficient model that makes accurate predictions of lung cancer detection. The research also involved using transfer learning models such as <b>InceptionV3, Xception, EfficientNetB2, ResNet50 and VGG-16</b>. All transfer learning models used a different number of layers and trainable parameters, with the majority of the transfer learning models obtaining satisfactory model accuracies on the testing data with minimal loss.<br>
